## 🔧 Setup Actions Required

### 1. Enable Firestore Database

You need to enable Firestore in the Firebase Console:

**Steps:**

1. Go to [Firebase Firestore Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/edugenie-h-ba04c/firestore)
2. Click "Create database"
3. Choose "Start in test mode" (for development)
4. Select a location (choose closest to your users)
5. Click "Done"

### 2. Configure Security Rules (Optional for Development)

For development, you can use these test rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true; // WARNING: For testing only!
    }
  }
}
```
