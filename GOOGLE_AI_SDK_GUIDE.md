## Google AI SDK Configuration

### Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Google AI SDK API Key
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Optional: Firestore for data persistence (existing)
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/service-account-key.json
FIRESTORE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

### Model Configuration

The system uses the following Google AI models:

- **Text Generation**: `gemini-1.5-flash` - For lesson content and explanations
- **Chat**: `gemini-1.5-flash` - For interactive conversations
- **Embeddings**: `text-embedding-004` - For semantic similarity (future use)

### Generation Parameters

```python
generation_config = {
    'temperature': 0.7,      # Creativity vs consistency balance
    'top_p': 0.8,           # Nucleus sampling parameter
    'top_k': 40,            # Top-k sampling parameter
    'max_output_tokens': 2048,  # Maximum response length
}
```

## API Integration Examples

### Content Generation

```python
from core.ai_client import get_ai_client

ai_client = get_ai_client()

# Generate lesson content
lesson = await ai_client.generate_lesson_content(
    topic="Quadratic Equations",
    difficulty="intermediate",
    student_profile={
        "learning_style": "visual",
        "grade_level": "high school"
    }
)

# Generate quiz questions
questions = await ai_client.generate_quiz_questions(
    topic="Quadratic Equations",
    difficulty="intermediate",
    num_questions=5
)
```

### Assessment Analysis

```python
# Analyze student response
analysis = await ai_client.analyze_student_response(
    question="Solve: x² - 5x + 6 = 0",
    student_answer="x = 2, x = 3",
    correct_answer="x = 2, x = 3"
)

# Get personalized recommendations
recommendations = await ai_client.generate_personalized_recommendations({
    'strengths': ['basic algebra', 'linear equations'],
    'weaknesses': ['factoring', 'word problems'],
    'recent_scores': [0.85, 0.72, 0.91]
})
```

### Interactive Chat

```python
# Handle chat interaction
chat_response = await ai_client.create_interactive_chat_response(
    user_message="I'm struggling with quadratic functions",
    context={
        "current_topic": "algebra",
        "student_level": "high school",
        "recent_performance": "needs_improvement"
    }
)
```

## Fallback Mechanisms

The system includes comprehensive fallback mechanisms to ensure functionality even when AI services are unavailable:

1. **Template-based Content**: Pre-defined lesson templates for common topics
2. **Rule-based Analysis**: Simple assessment logic for basic evaluation
3. **Static Recommendations**: Default study suggestions based on common patterns

## Error Handling

The AI integration includes robust error handling:

- **API Failures**: Graceful degradation to fallback methods
- **Rate Limiting**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Invalid Responses**: JSON parsing error recovery
- **Network Issues**: Timeout handling and connection retry

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy

- **Content Caching**: Generated lessons cached for reuse
- **Response Caching**: Common chat responses cached for faster delivery
- **Model Selection**: Optimized model selection based on use case

### Async Operations

- All AI operations are asynchronous to prevent blocking
- Concurrent processing for multiple content generation requests
- Background processing for non-critical AI tasks

## Usage Patterns

### Lesson Planning Workflow

1. Student selects learning topic
2. AI generates personalized lesson content
3. System presents interactive lesson with examples
4. AI creates practice questions based on lesson
5. Student performance is analyzed by AI
6. Personalized recommendations generated

### Assessment Workflow

1. Student completes quiz or practice problems
2. AI analyzes each response for correctness and understanding
3. Detailed feedback generated with explanations
4. Strengths and weaknesses identified
5. Personalized study plan recommendations created

### Chat Assistant Workflow

1. Student asks question or requests help
2. AI analyzes context and intent
3. Personalized response generated with suggestions
4. Follow-up questions provided to enhance learning
5. Study resources recommended based on conversation

## Best Practices

1. **Prompt Engineering**: Well-structured prompts for consistent AI responses
2. **Context Management**: Maintaining conversation and learning context
3. **Quality Assurance**: AI response validation and filtering
4. **Privacy Protection**: No personal information sent to AI models
5. **Cost Optimization**: Efficient API usage and caching strategies

## Monitoring and Analytics

- **API Usage Tracking**: Monitor AI service usage and costs
- **Response Quality**: Track AI response effectiveness
- **Performance Metrics**: Measure impact on student learning outcomes
- **Error Rates**: Monitor and alert on AI service failures

## Future Enhancements

- **Multimodal AI**: Integration of image and video analysis
- **Voice Interaction**: Speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities
- **Advanced Personalization**: Deeper learning style adaptation
- **Collaborative Learning**: AI-facilitated group learning experiences

## Security Considerations

- **API Key Management**: Secure storage and rotation of API keys
- **Data Privacy**: No student personal data sent to external AI services
- **Content Filtering**: AI-generated content validation and safety checks
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to AI features
